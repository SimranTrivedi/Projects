1. Telco Customer Churn:
This is a machine learning project that predicts which customers are likely to leave a telecom company (churn).
I used a dataset from Kaggle and built a simple model to identify high-risk customers.

Dataset:
 Telco Customer Churn Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data

 Goals are:
 1. Predict if a customer will churn
 2. Analyze which customers are at high risk
 3. Estimate revenue loss if the customers leave

 Steps:
 1. Cleaned the data
 2. Converted text to numbers(0 or 1)
 3. Trained the model using random forest
 4. Evaluation using a confusion matrix
 5. Simulated possible revenue loss and recovery
    
Tools Used
1.  Python
2.  Pandas
3.  Scikit-learn
4.  Google Colab
